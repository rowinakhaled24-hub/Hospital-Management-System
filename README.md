# Hospital Management System 
Author:[Rowina khaled]

## Project Description
This is a Python-based Hospital Management System developed to manage medical staff, patients, room allocations, and appointments efficiently.

## OOP Concepts Used
In this project, I have implemented the following Object-Oriented Programming concepts:
* **Classes & Objects**: Created classes for Doctors, Patients, Rooms, Bills and Appointments.
* **Inheritance**: `Doctor` and `Patient` classes inherit from the base `Person` class.
* **Polymorphism**: Used the same method name `describe()` to provide different outputs for different classes.

## Project Features
* Register new doctors with their specializations.
* Add patients and link them to specific rooms.
* Manage room availability (ICU/Normal).
* Schedule and view medical appointments.
* Generate billing for patients.

## How to Run the Project
1. Make sure you have **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** installed.
2. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
3. Open the file and run all cells sequentially.

## Implementation Type
  **Jupyter Notebook** (.ipynb)
